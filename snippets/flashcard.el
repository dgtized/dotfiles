;;; Release date: Wed Jun  8 09:50:13 1994

;;; The author welcomes suggestions and bug reports.
;;; However, the author offers NO WARRANTY, express or implied.

;;; The purpose of `flashcard' is to drill the user over a
;;; user-created database of questions and answers.  It records
;;; scores, and can tailor the drill according to the user's past
;;; performance.  To quickly summarize its features, I'll describe an
;;; example.

;;; I create a vocabulary file; the top line indicates that there are
;;; two fields in this file, called `dutch' and `english'.  (But I
;;; could have three or more fields if desired.)  I then enter a bunch
;;; of pairs of Dutch and English words, one pair on a line.  E.g.:

;;;     !% Fields: dutch	english
;;;
;;;     wie	who
;;;     huis	house
;;;     straat	street

;;; etc.  Then I can use `flashcard' to drill me on this file, either
;;; presenting me with the `dutch' field and letting me think of the
;;; `english' field, or vice versa.  `flashcard' will not check my
;;; answers (unless I'm in multiple-choice mode); I must judge if I
;;; got the answer right or wrong, and hit `r' or `w' accordingly.
;;; `flashcard' keeps score for each field and each record: how many
;;; times I've gotten it right, how many times I've gotten it wrong,
;;; and when was the last time I got it right.  This information is
;;; stored in a separate score file.

;;; At some later date I can come back to the same vocabulary
;;; file, and have `flashcard' drill me on selected cards, based
;;; on criteria such as "all cards which I haven't gotten right
;;; in a month" or "all cards which I've gotten right less than
;;; 75% of the time."
;;; Multiple vocabulary files can be loaded, mixed together, and
;;; drilled on simultaneously.  When the drilling is done, scores will
;;; be saved to the appropriate separate score files.

;;; Someday perhaps there will be info documentation with all the
;;; information organized, and a nice tutorial.

;;; Some sample Japanese vocabulary files can be obtained by anonymous
;;; ftp from:
;;;     crl.nmsu.edu:CLR/multiling/japanese/vocabulary
;;;     kuso.shef.ac.uk:pub/japanese/larstango
;;;     ftp.cc.monash.edu.au:pub/nihongo/mangajin-vocab
;;; However, you need Mule (Multilingual Emacs) or Nemacs (Japanese
;;; Emacs) to display the characters.

;;; Installation:
;;; Copy flashcard.el into a directory in your load-path.  Byte-compile
;;; it if desired.  Put the following in your .emacs file:
;;;    (autoload 'flashcard "flashcard"
;;;       "Use Flashcard package to drill on flashcards." t)

;;; LCD Archive Entry:
;;; flashcard.el|Lars Huttar|huttar@cs.oberlin.edu
;;; |Selective drilling on flashcards, tailored to your past performance
;;; |1994/06/08 09:50:13|0.95|

;;; Note: There is only occurrence of Flashcard going on per emacs process.

;;; To do:
;;; (x means done or fixed)
;;; x put in a proper LCD Entry.
;;; - document what "Overall" and "This card" fields mean.
;;;   I.e. "This card" is persistent, and is specific not only to the
;;;   card but also to the question/answer field combination.
;;; x speed up response time (especially to `r' and `w' commands) and/or
;;;   display "Working..."-type message.
;;; x There seems to be a bug: fc-modified-scores is not being set
;;;   to nil after saving.
;;; x oops, the first card is not being filtered for elegibility
;;;   criteria.  I guess we need to set fc-current-card = -1 and
;;;   call fc-next-card.
;;; x probably remove redisplay-question/answer; just erase the buffer
;;;   and start over? (what about case of redisplay answer and ... uh...)
;;; x finish multi-choice support by modifying fc-display-answer, (done)
;;;   fc-redisplay-{question,answer}, and the mechanism for changing
;;;   the options fc-num-choices and fc-multiple-choice (to update
;;;   immediately).
;;; - maybe put something in the modeline indicating the filename (or
;;;   title) of the (first?) file being drilled on.
;;; x move defun-subst's before the defun's?
;;; x enhance options help by letting user get help for one option
;;;   at the bottom of the help buffer by hitting that key.
;;; - maybe a command to go backward without undo.
;;; x add "faces" for a snazzier look; highlight the question and
;;;   the answer with a different weight/color/etc.
;;; - maybe I should re-instate separate keys for load-file (chucking
;;;   previously loaded vocab) and add-file (adding to previously
;;;   loaded vocab).
;;; x new variable fc-num-choices, which controls how many choices
;;;   to present in multiple-choice mode.
;;; x Maybe a new variable, fc-filter-equals or some such.
;;;   This would mean, filter out cards on which the question field
;;;   and the answer field are equal.
;;; x In options, if new value == old value, don't update anything. (done)
;;; x Selection based on score criteria is already in place, and,
;;;   I believe, tested.  Now set up an interface for setting the
;;;   criteria.  Use letters l,p,r for options. (done)
;;; x Enhance options help to show current values of options.  Use
;;;   columns "Key", "Option name", "Current Value". (done)
;;; - This is probably not something I'll do before the first release,
;;;   but it's something to think about: auto-saving of scores.
;;;   Save the current score data to an auto-save file(s) periodically.
;;;   Emacs would take care of this for us, if we kept the score data
;;;   in buffers that were visiting those score files.  However, that
;;;   would be a pretty radical change to the current data structures.
;;;   Is there some way to have an arbitrary hook called at auto-save
;;;   time, to save some kind of state to a file?  Hmm, there is an
;;;   auto-save-hook variable, but it's not available in Mule.
;;;   Certainly, we want to be able to save score data when Emacs
;;;   gets a fatal error.
;;;   How does save-some-buffers EXITING work? (it saves some
;;;   non-file buffers)
;;;   Until this is solved, say in the docs that the user should
;;;   save frequently to avoid losing data.
;;; x update the Question/Answer ("foo"): "bar" stuff when changing
;;;   the fc-question/answer-field, even when question-field and
;;;   answer-field are the same.  To do this, abstract out the
;;;   functions to redraw question and answer (and other) lines.
;;;   (done, I believe)
;;; x Make sure field names are consistent, what with defaults and
;;;   all.  (done, I think)
;;; x put the loaded records in right order, not reverse order.
;;;   Do this by keeping an fc-records-tail variable and using it
;;;   to extend the list. (done, I think)
;;; x keep track of the user's scores.  Can currently load multiple files,
;;;   drill on them together, and save the data into their respective
;;;   score files.  Tested with multiple files but not in multiple
;;;   directions (e.g. eng->dutch, dutch->eng).
;;; / when sure about score file i/o, change %d's to %x's in format.
;;;   Actually, why bother?  It probably wouldn't make things clearer,
;;;   and the space savings would only be about 10%.
;;; x perhaps add a multiple choice option.  Then the program could
;;;   easily check the user's answer.  If so, we should reserve
;;;   the keys `a' thru `e' or so.  Or maybe use digits?  Digits.
;;; - maybe let some fields be declared non-unique; e.g.
;;;   a gender field for nouns.  Flashcard would not attempt
;;;   to drill from that field to other fields, nor store data
;;;   about such drills.
;;; - a command, available in either of the two states, that marks the
;;;   current flashcard (record) as being well-known, i.e. tells
;;;   Flashcard not to drill on it anymore.  The flashcard is not
;;;   erased from the vocab file, but its score data contains a flag
;;;   so it will no longer be drilled on.  Thus different students
;;;   using the same vocab file can have different words marked as
;;;   too easy in their own score files.
;;; - Provide a way to clear the scores for the current card; perhaps
;;;   to edit all three values arbitrarily.
;;; x add the ability to back up (just one question or all the way
;;;   through a quiz?), undoing whatever score modifications were
;;;   done.  (done, just one question)
;;; x set up synchronized variables fc-current-card-num and fc-current-card,
;;;   to cut down on repeated arefs.  (fc-current-card-num would be what
;;;   fc-current-card used to be.)  (done)
;;; x structure / abstract out the line-positions of the question,
;;;   answer, and help areas.  Adjust help according to the number
;;;   of fields and whether the display-extra-fields variable is set.
;;;   Compute each field's position based on the previous, not as
;;;   an absolute position. (done)
;;; x Possibly add a variable to turn off help, for slow terminals.
